#+TITLE: Abe's Doom Emacs Configuration


This is my configuration for Doom Emacs. It uses Babel so I can create a config file as an .org file. I make changes to the config.org file and bable updates the config.el file.

A couple of things about this repo
1. I am not a programmer, I barely know how to use git (although I thinks its awesome). I am mainly a writer meaning I use Emacs almost exclusively in org-mode.
2. This is mostly for educational purposes, but go ahead a use the parts of it that you want.
3. If you have a pull request or something similar, I may do it, but I've never done any of that I use git for myself.
4. The code has comments, but not enough. I'll work on making more comments in the future.
